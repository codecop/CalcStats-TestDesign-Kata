# CalcStats Test Design Kata

Write tests for the code. It should cover the functionality described in [Calculate Stats](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/calc_stats.html). 

Start with the "happy path" main functionality then move on to edge cases. If you find a bug, write a failing test to expose it then fix the code so the test passes.

This exercise could be used with this learning hour: [Three parts of a test](https://sammancoaching.org/learning_hours/test_design/three_parts_of_a_test.html)
